    Individual part: For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished (just create a header for each group member on the .html page). If possible include elements like:
        - What type of data would you like to visualize, and where would you get access to this data?
        - What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?
        - Who is the intended audience?
        - A sketch/mockup of the visualization.

    <p>Past and live visualization (with maybe a a slight delay) of meteorological data such as wind, clouds, temperature, wave
        size, precipitation could be an interesting topic among many others.</p>
    <p>The use that could be made of it could be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Recreational, that is to say, useful for all lambdas individuals who would like to obtain meteorological information.</li>
        <li>Professional, because this tool could for example highlight the importance of wind energy in certain windy areas
            or assist teams or professional missions which depend on the weather.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data set could be represented in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            On a map, which uses areas of color, flow, relief, to represent for example the direction of the wind and its intensity or
            even different areas of temperature or precipitation. Key pointers could also be added to the map, such as the
            names of major cities, or recognized surf / kitesurfing / windsurfing spots. This visualization of the data could
            be suitable for a live visualization of meteorological data. It could also look like at the one made by the
            <a href="https://www.windy.com/?55.264,9.079,5">Windy</a> website:
            <div class="centered">
                <img class="large-image" src="http://www.addictootech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tracking-Hurricane-matthew-with-weather-tracking-app-windyty.jpg">
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            On charts like point clouds, histogram and so on ... That could particularly be suitable for the study of some meteorological
            factors in recent years until today. For example here is a possible representation, for the city of Toulouse
            in France:
            <div class="centered">
                <img class="large-image" src="http://www.donneesbrutes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/screencast-2017-06-18-15-22-48.gif">
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>All the useful data for this visualization could be found on the websites of the official meteorological and climatological
        services of the country or countries concerned. Or by using some APIs like the one provided by
        <a href="http://api.windyty.com/">Windy</a>.</p>

    <p> When using public transportation, I often have to walk for couple of minutes to get to the closest useful stop/station
        just to see my bus leaving in front of me while I wait at the crosswalk. So I'd like to see if the bus stop I walk
        to everyday has the most optimal location for the majority of its users. Bus stops are relatively easy to move, unlike
        train/metro stations and moving them by 100m or on the other side of the intersection could save minutes and reduce
        bus misses.</p>
    <p> With data from Rejseplanen or Google Maps we could plot the ways people walk to bus stops. Potential overlaps of these
        paths and their intensity would then suggest possible relocation spots. For stops with multiple buses stopping there,
        we could color code the actual bus people take. This would be useful for large intersections where e.g. bus 1A stops
        on the west side but bus 2A stops on the east side and people changing between them have to cross the street twice.

        I am interested in making sport visualizations and more particularly basketball-specific visualizations (e.g. shot-charts,
        performance charts, etc.). As a proof of concept, I could focus on specific leagues such as the NBA and go into even
        further details, by choosing specific teams. There is a variety of freely accessible statistical data about nba games,
        teams and players on
        <a href="http://stats.nba.com">stats.nba.com</a> which can be used for this purpose. This could be used to make performance analysis and possibly
        be used to predict future games. The intended audience would be basketball enthusiasts (such as myself) and other
        people interested in using basketball statistics for one or another reason. If it becomes to be something exceptionally
        good, hopefully the NBA themselves will show interest in it &#9786;. My idea is nothing innovative, quite contrary
        - there are plenty of existing visualisations on this topic (e.g.
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/sports/wizards-shooting-stars/">Wizards shooting stars</a>
        , or
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/selfishgene/psychology-of-a-professional-athlete">Psychology of a Professional Athlete</a>
        which can serve me as inspiration but most of the ones I have found were team-specific or even player-specific for past years.
        Instead, I am rather interested in making an abstract interactive solution, which takes live data from NBA and continuously
        adds it to the charts.
