    <p>This visualization allows us to observe the temperature changes, between 1880 and 2016, according to the different seasons of the year.</p>
    <p>From these different line charts we notice a very slight increase in temperature for the winter, autumn and spring seasons. Nevertheless we realize that it is for the winter season that global warming is the most visible. Indeed, we notice that the temperature has on average increased by about 2 Â°C until today. These different line charts of the evolution of the temperature during the seasons also allow us to realize that on average some years were more rigorous than others and that there is a consequent temperature difference between the summer months and winter while the temperatures of the spring and autumn months remain almost identical.</p>

    <h2 class="centered">Question 3.2 (Alex Lonchambon)</h2>
    <p>We want to illustrate the phenomenon of the increasing temperature due to global warming. Thus the addition of a dynamic map visualization could help to evaluate this temperature evolution. Take for example this <a href="http://100ansdetour.fr/">data visualization</a>, which illustrates 100 years of the Tour de France. We could realize a visualization similar to this one, which can allowed to visualize on a map the evolution of the temperature (associated with a color scheme going from blue for a cold temperature and judged in the norm, against a red color for a temperature considered hot and out of the norm) during a specific year.</p>
    <p>Moreover, with a dynamic map visualization it would be possible to represent any other elements related to global warming, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The evolution of the rising waters</li>
        <li>The effect on animals and plants (migration, disappearance)</li> 
    </ul>>
    <p>These elements could be added as streams or color boxes to the geographical area or could also be represented as statistical data in a side window.</p>
    <p>This type of visualization could also make it possible to compare two years in particular.</p>
