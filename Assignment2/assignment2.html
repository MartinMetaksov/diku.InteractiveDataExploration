    <h1 class="centered dark-red">Assignment 2 - How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?</h1>

    <p>Temperatures measured on land and at sea for more than a century show that Earth's globally averaged surface
        temperature is rising. Since 1970, global surface temperature rose at an average rate of about 0.17°C
        per decade—more than twice as fast as the 0.07°C per decade increase observed for the entire period of recorded
        observations (1880-2015). The average global temperature for 2016 was 0.94°C above the 20<sup>th</sup>
        century average of 13.9°C, surpassing the previous record warmth of 2015 by 0.04°C.

    <h2 class="centered">St. Petersburg (Annual temperatures)</h2>
    <svg id="plot-minmax-st_petersburg" class="centered" width="960" height="500"></svg>

    <p>For these 2 visualizations, we computed annual min, max and average temperatures to show how annual temperature
        ranges differed from year to year in Copenhagen and St. Petersburg.</p>
    <p>As expected, we can see signs of global warming by observing the trendline of average annual temperatures
        computed by least-squares fit. In Copenhagen,
        the temperature between years 1880-2011 changed by approx. 2 °C.
        In St. Petersburg, the temperature between years 1880-2016 changed by approx. 3 °C.</p>

    <h2 class="centered">Zurich (Seasons)</h2>

    <p>This visualization allows us to observe the temperature changes, between 1880 and 2016, according to the different
        seasons of the year.</p>
    <p>From these different line charts we notice a very slight increase in temperature for the winter, autumn and
        spring seasons. Nevertheless we realize that it is for the winter season that global warming is the most visible.
        Indeed, we notice that the temperature has on average increased by about 2 °C until today. These different line
        charts of the evolution of the temperature during the seasons also allow us to realize that on average some
        years were more rigorous than others and that there is a consequent temperature difference between the summer
        months and winter while the temperatures of the spring and autumn months remain almost identical.</p>

        The bonus pie charts above show the monthly temperatures over all years with provided data for the corresponding cities (Copenhagen, St. Petersburg and Zurich). The color corresponds to the mean temperatures
        in the respective month (using a color scheme similar to coolwarm). Hovering on a month toggles more information including the min and max temperatures for that month throughout all years, as well as the mean value.
        Most importantly, the hover box shows a trend, which is the difference between the temperature between the first and the last years available in the data set. Positive values indicate an increase in temperatures, while negative
        values - a decrease. It can be seen from the charts that an increase predominates for most of the months in all 3 cities, indicating once again that the global warming is a fact.

    <h2 class="centered">Question 3.1 (Marek Hlava)</h2>
    <p> So far we have shown that weather changed in a few places but we want to see if it's a large scale phenomenon.
        By collecting temperature data from the whole world and computing differences between annual average temperatures from 100
        years ago and now, we could show how temperature changed globally. Picture of temperature differences by
        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-year-on-record-globally/">NASA</a>.</p>
    <p> Another interesting map visualization would be to show the changes in rainfall over land areas to see if "dry areas get
        drier and wet areas get wetter" as one
        <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-is-altering-rainfall-patterns-worldwide/">
            study says</a>. Or to the contrary, "in both wet and dry regions, we see these significant and robust
        increases in heavy precipitation", as found by
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/global-warming-already-driving-increases-in-rainfall-extremes-1.19508">
            another study</a>. We could use data by <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/">NCDC</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="centered">Question 3.2 (Alex Lonchambon)</h2>
    <p>We want to illustrate the phenomenon of the increasing temperature due to global warming. Thus the addition of
        a dynamic map visualization could help to evaluate this temperature evolution. Take for example this
        <a href="http://100ansdetour.fr/">data visualization</a>, which illustrates 100 years of the Tour de France.
        We could realize a visualization similar to this one, which can allowed to visualize on a map the evolution
        of the temperature (associated with a color scheme going from blue for a cold temperature and judged in the norm,
        against a red color for a temperature considered hot and out of the norm) during a specific year.</p>
    <p>Moreover, with a dynamic map visualization it would be possible to represent any other elements related to global
        warming, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The evolution of the rising waters</li>
        <li>The effect on animals and plants (migration, disappearance)</li>
    </ul>>
    <p>These elements could be added as streams or color boxes to the geographical area or could also be represented as
        statistical data in a side window.</p>
    <p>This type of visualization could also make it possible to compare two years in particular.</p>
    <h2 class="centered">Question 3.3 (Martin Metaksov)</h2>
    <!--
        How big data sets are reasonable to load in d3 visualizations? What types of visualizations does a limit like that exclude?
        Give examples of visualizations that must be based on large data sets and discuss how they deal with this.
        Could you have reduced the size of the data sets in this assignment?
        -->
    <p>
        D3 is meant for visualizing complex data sets, with high dimensionality, allowing for visualizing multiple levels of details and
        interactively displaying information which is otherwise difficult to read. However, we do not believe this is the case with sets large
        in size, as there will always be a certain bottleneck reached when loading (e.g. due to cluttering the DOM, or other browser limitations).
        The larger the sets and the more the computational logic, the more the CPU will be loaded, thus the slower the interaction. At a certain
        point this can lead to unbearable delays (e.g. possibly files larger than 100MB will present an issue).
    </p>
    <p>
        It is often the case that large data sets can undergo certain pre-processing, encoding, <a href="http://www.forceflow.be/2013/10/07/morton-encodingdecoding-through-bit-interleaving-implementations/">morton encoding</a> and more.
        This could reduce the sizes and allow for less CPU operations later, which could significantly speedup the processing of large data sets.
        One example can be seen in <a href="www.idav.ucdavis.edu/func/return_pdf?pub_id=162">www.idav.ucdavis.edu/func/return_pdf?pub_id=162</a>.
        Furthermore, it is often possible to load only portions of the data at a time and visualize them only. As seen in <a href="http://polymaps.org/ex/flickr.html">http://polymaps.org/ex/flickr.html</a> this provides
        a significant downside, as the data takes some time to load on each interaction, however can be displayed in a reasonable amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this particular project, the sizes of the data sets has not been a problem as they were not larger than a few kilobytes.
        With this said, there was no reason to reduce their sizes.
