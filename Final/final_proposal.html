        <p>
            Highly motivated by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/donyoe/exploring-ufo-sightings">Exploring UFO sightings</a> kernel on kaggle,
            we have decided to work with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/data">UFO Sightings data set</a> and
            tell a story/try to answer several questions about extraterrestrial life, its existence, its appearances to the human kind with the supporting evidence of
            the data set. Most of all, we are interested in observing if the stories described in the data add up and if they can be related to certain patterns, which could then
            lead to certain discoveries.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have chosen this data because of its consistency (e.g. we need not deal with cleaning the data or removing rows with NULL values, etc.) and the
            interesting nature of its dimensions. We can explore it from geographical, historical, categorical perspectives and its fine granularity can lead to many meaningful
            observations. Additionally, the kaggle kernels related to this data set are rich of inspiration and visualisations, which
            we can use as a starting point for making a good story about aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our plan is to start exposing the data by showing a world map (which will be the main visualisation of this project) with all occurrences
            (similar to the one in the "Exploring UFO sightings" kernel) and with high interactivity - e.g. toggle between continents, hover on sightings, etc. -
            with the purpose of getting a highly detailed overview of the sightings. Additionally we have the idea of adding an animated timeline, which will hopefully enable
            users to observe patterns in the data occurrences over time and give a meaning to it (Inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/tentotheminus9/mulder-s-worst-nightmare-animation/code">Mulder's Worst Nightmare</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            In an additional visualisation(s) we will show additional interactive properties of the data, in order to attempt and obtain further meaning from
            the other aspects of the data and help extract valuable conclusions in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will end the project with a discussion of our findings and discoveries on the data set.
