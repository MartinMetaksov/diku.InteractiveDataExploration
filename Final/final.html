            <h3>UFO Context</h3>
            <p>
                When we think of a UFO, we often imagine things of science fiction, but we do not imagine that this can be a
                serious subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, during the month of December 2017, the <i><u>New York Times</u></i> revealed that between 2007 and 2012, the
                Pentagon had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to fund a UFO research program (known as the <i>Blue Book
                Project</i>, between 1952 and 1969 and then known as <i><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/EztiaVGDAjA">Glowing
                Auras and Black Money)</a></i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                These news surprised many people, but in reality, the UFO obsession of the American government is very old,
                and dates from 1947.
            </p>
            <p>
                Namely in that year, <b>Kenneth Arnold</b> – an American aviator – observed a swarm of nine flying objects that he
                cannot identify and in a few days all the American press was interested in the story.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="http://www.ufo.it/ufo/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1947-06-27-SanAnotnioEx-TITOLONE-M.png" alt="" />
            </p>
            <p>
                In the years that followed, hundreds of Americans also claimed to have seen strange flying objects in
                the sky and many mistook them for extraterrestrial vessels.
            </p>
            <p>
                In response to all these testimonies, the US military decided to launch a large scientific study on UFOs
                which have for main objective to find an explanation to their appearances. And the result is conclusive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, between 1952 and 1959, the US Air Force recorded twelve thousand incidents involving
                unidentified flying objects and found a scientific explanation for 97% of these occurrences. However,
                the possibility that UFOs are the manifestation of extraterrestrial threats continues to make its way.
                In 1985 <b>President Ronald Reagan</b> said he was even ready to collaborate with the Soviet bloc in case
                of invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                These months, following the revelations of the <i><u>New York Times</u></i>, the Pentagon claims that it no longer
                investigates UFOs but according to <b>Luis Elizondo</b> – the former director of the confidential program – that
                investigations are continuing today but under another form.
            </p>
            <h3>Project motivation</h3>
            <p>
                Inspired by the <i>Blue Book Project</i>, <i>Glowing Auras</i> and <i>Black Money</i>, we wanted to explore some of the
                available <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/data">data</a> on the topic and hopefully
                get some useful insights on the topic. The data set itself was rather large and provided a variety of different features,
                such as date and time of a sighting, city, state (if in the US), country, shape, duration, comments, latitude, longitude.
                This implied that it would be quite difficult to obtain any useful information out of the data directly, as it would be
                close to impossible to read every single of the 80000 rows of data and make any meaningful conclusions from it. Instead
                we have introduced a slightly different approach, by using interactive visualisation and creating a timeline of events,
                showing only a limited number of sightings at a time. By doing this, we would be able to see whether some of the same UFO
                shapes have been sighted at close intervals of times and nearby locations. This would imply that more than one person
                would have seen something that looked alike in the same area and at approximately the same time. Hypothetically, while the odds
                that the sightings regard the exact same object are low and the probability of a coincidence is high, we could
                still obtain a period of time and an object type, which we could then use to do further research.
            </p>
            <p>
                UFO's have been an open topic for many years and yet by this day it is very unclear whether the stories we have
                read, heard or seen anywhere are even true or if they are just the creation of people's vivid imagination. Furthermore
                people tend to imagine more when they have recently been introduced to the topic. For example, we would expect an increased number
                of sightings.during the period X-files was being broadcast on TV. With this said, we believe that it is extremely
                difficult (near impossible) to make precise and correct conclusions on this topic, thus our focus has been set on
                making connections between events and registered sightings in the data set.
            </p>
            <h3>Visualisations and set up</h3>
            <p>
                The main visualisation of the project is a world map with a timeline functionality. We have added the possibility of
                choosing a start and an end date for sightings. The user can then play (by clicking the play button, or by pressing 's'
                on their keyboard)the sequence and see sightings appearing on the map. We display a day of data each second, which we
                believe was the optimal time mapping. A legend on the side represents the different shapes that have been registered
                throughout the data set. Furthermore, each sighting is represented by a different size. This is linked to their duration,
                where a smaller radius corresponds to a shorter sighting duration and a larger radius to a longer duration. Additionally,
                each dot can be hovered, providing further information about a specific sighting, in order to allow users to pause the sequence
                and compare different sightings.
