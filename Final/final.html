            <h3>UFO Context</h3>
            <p>
                When we think of a UFO, we often imagine things of science fiction, but we do not imagine that this can be a
                serious subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, during the month of December 2017, the <i><u>New York Times</u></i> revealed that between 2007 and 2012, the
                Pentagon had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to fund a UFO research program (known as the <i>Blue Book
                Project</i>, between 1952 and 1969 and then known as <i><a href="https://youtu.be/EztiaVGDAjA">Glowing
                Auras and Black Money)</a></i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This news surprised many people, but in reality, the UFOs obsession of the American government is very old,
                and it dates from 1947.
            </p>
            <p>
                Indeed, that year, <b>Kenneth Arnold</b> – an American aviator – observed a swarm of nine flying objects that he
                cannot identify and in a few days, all the American press is interested in its history.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the years that followed, hundreds of Americans also claimed to have seen strange flying objects in
                the sky and many mistook them for extraterrestrial vessels.
            </p>
            <p>
                In response to all these testimonies, the US military decided to launch a large scientific study on UFOs
                which have for main objective to find an explanation to their appearances. And the result is conclusive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, between 1952 and 1959, the US Air Force recorded twelve thousand incidents involving
                unidentified flying objects and found a scientific explanation for 97% of these occurrences. However,
                the possibility that UFOs are the manifestation of extraterrestrial threats continues to make its way
                and in 1985 <b>President Ronald Reagan</b> said he was even ready to collaborate with the Soviet bloc in case
                of invasion.
            </p>
            <p>
                These months, following the revelations of the <i><u>New York Times</u></i>, the Pentagon claims that it no longer
                investigates UFOs but according to <b>Luis Elizondo</b> – the former director of the confidential program – that
                investigations are continuing today but under another form.
            </p>
            <h3>Our objectives</h3>
            <p>
                As the <i>Blue Book Project</i>, <i>Glowing Auras</i> and <i>Black Money</i>, we want – through the
                <i>UFO Sightings data set</i> – answer several questions about extraterrestrial life, but more generally we
                want to describe and find an explanation to the appearance of UFOs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">article</a></i>
                of the <i><u>New York Times</u></i>, UFOs are again a hot topic and thanks to 80 000 data of the
                <i>UFO Sightings data set</i>, we will illustrate all of its data by showing a dynamic world map of
                all occurrences and  also additional visualizations, in order to describe and interpret all the patterns discovered.
