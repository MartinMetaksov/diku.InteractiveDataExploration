                <h3>UFO Context</h3>
                <p>
                    When we think of a UFO, we often imagine things of science fiction, but we do not imagine that this can be a
                    serious subject.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the month of December 2017, the <i><u>New York Times</u></i> revealed that between 2007 and 2012, the
                    Pentagon had spent hundreds of millions of dollars to fund a UFO research program (known as the <i>Blue Book
                    Project</i> between 1952 and 1969, and then known as <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/EztiaVGDAjA">Glowing
                    Auras and Black Money)</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These news surprised many people, but in reality the UFO obsession of the American government is very old
                    and dates back to 1947. Namely in that year, <b>Kenneth Arnold</b>, an American aviator, observed a swarm of
                    nine flying objects that he couldn't identify, and in a few days all the American press was interested in the story.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="http://www.ufo.it/ufo/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/1947-06-27-SanAnotnioEx-TITOLONE-M.png" alt="" class="centered" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the years that followed, hundreds of Americans also claimed to have seen strange flying objects in
                    the sky and many mistook them for alien craft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In response to all these testimonies, the US military decided to launch a large scientific study on UFOs
                    which have for main objective to find an explanation to their appearances. And the result was conclusive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, between 1952 and 1959, the US Air Force recorded twelve thousand incidents involving
                    unidentified flying objects and found a scientific explanation for 97% of these occurrences. However,
                    the possibility that UFOs are the manifestation of extraterrestrial threats continued to make its way.
                    In 1985, <b>President Ronald Reagan</b> said he was even ready to collaborate with the Soviet bloc in case
                    of an alien invasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, following the revelations of the <i><u>New York Times</u></i>, the Pentagon claims that it no longer
                    investigates UFOs, but according to <b>Luis Elizondo</b>, the former director of the confidential program,
                    investigations are continuing today but in another form.

            <div id="project-motivation">
                <h3>Project motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the <i>Blue Book Project</i>, <i>Glowing Auras</i> and <i>Black Money</i>, we wanted to explore some of the
                    available <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings/data">data</a> on the topic and hopefully
                    get some useful insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The data set itself was rather large and provided a variety of different features,
                    such as date and time of a sighting, city, state, country, shape, duration, comments, latitude and longitude.
                    This implied that it would be quite difficult to obtain any useful information out of the data directly, as it would be
                    close to impossible to read every single of the 80000 rows of data and make any meaningful conclusions from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, we have introduced a slightly different approach. By using interactive visualisations and creating a timeline of events,
                    we are showing only a limited number of sightings at a time. By doing this, we would be able to see whether some of the same UFO
                    shapes have been seen at close intervals of times and nearby locations. This would imply that more than one person
                    would have seen something that looked alike in the same area and at approximately the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hypothetically, while the odds
                    that the sightings regard the exact same object are low and the probability of a coincidence is high, we could
                    still obtain a period of time and an object type, which we could then use to do further research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    UFO's have been an open topic for many years, and yet by this day it is very unclear whether the stories we have
                    read, heard or seen anywhere are even true or if they are just the creation of people's vivid imagination. Furthermore
                    people tend to imagine more when they have recently been introduced to the topic. For example, we would expect an increased number
                    of sightings during the period The X-files was being broadcast on TV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this said, we believe that it is extremely
                    difficult (near impossible) to make precise and correct conclusions on this topic, thus our focus has been set on
                    making connections between events and registered sightings in the data set.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="visualisations-and-setup">
                <h3>Visualizations and set up</h3>
                <p>
                    The main visualization of the project is a world map with a timeline functionality. We have added the possibility of
                    choosing a start and an end date for sightings. The user can then play (by clicking the play button, or by pressing 's'
                    on their keyboard) the sequence and see sightings appearing on the map. We display a day of data each second, which we
                    believe was the optimal time mapping. A legend on the side represents the different shapes that have been registered
                    throughout the data set. Furthermore, each sighting is represented by a different size. This is linked to their duration,
                    where a smaller radius corresponds to a shorter sighting duration and a larger radius to a longer duration. Additionally,
                    each dot can be hovered, providing further information about a specific sighting, in order to allow users to pause the sequence
                    and compare different sightings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other visualizations are a complement to the map  and allow to extract quantitative data on UFOs. The different
                    visualizations proposed, can be chosen thanks to the drop-down list. Thus, it is possible to obtain information on
                    UFOs according to their shape, country, month and day of appearance, in order to attempt and obtain further
                    meaning from the other aspects of the data and help extract valuable conclusions in the end.

                    <h3>UFOs by shape</h3>
                    <p>
                        As said before, any unclassifiable appearance, find an explanation through physics. Thus, we can think of
                        seeing a flying saucer while it could be a meteorite, a ball lightning or a nightclub laser. This explains why
                        the light, circular, oval, fireballs, spherical, disks forms are among the most frequent forms of apparitions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is also the phenomena of visual perceptions that are quite explicable. The
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/autokinetic-effect">autokinetic effect</a>, for example,
                        can make you confuse a bright star with a flying saucer. Indeed, the lack of visual point around a star gives
                        you the impression that it moves when it is not, and this is due to small involuntary movements of the eyeball.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, classic forms such as spheres, circles, discs, oval forms are dominant because in the film
                        and television culture almost all UFOs associated to alien craft are represented by these forms. That is
                        an indirect influence on the visual perception of UFOs by society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More recently, it's the cigar UFO form that makes people talk about it. Indeed, on the 19 of October 2017,
                        a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/891121/Stephen-Hawking-UFO-space-NASA-solar-system-seti-alien-cigar-shaped-Oumuamua">mysterious long-limbed cigar</a>
                        -like asteroid was detected in our milky way. Called Oumuanua, "a messenger from afar"
                        in Hawaii, this UFO comes from another solar system. From astrophysicist's memory, nothing of this kind has ever
                        been observed. Nobody knows how to explain its totally unusual form. Is it an extraterrestrial civilization?
                        Is he endowed with an intelligence beyond us? These are currently the questions many professors are asking themselves...
                    </p>

                <div id="menu-countries" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h3>UFOs by country</h3>
                    <p>
                        The whole world witnesses flying objects, which are sometimes unidentified. Nevertheless, we note that some
                        areas are more conducive to the appearance of UFOs. They are called "UFO window areas" or "UFO portal". Based on the
                        data set, North America seems to be such an area with 70904 UFOs recorded in the US and 3588 in Canada, which
                        represent 92% of all UFOs in our database. However, this can also be explained by the fact that the US Air Force has
                        had the primary role of identifying and recording UFO sightings since the end of 1947.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thus, the differences in human and financial means also explains this important gap between the United States
                        and the rest of the world. Take, for example France, which has also had a study and information group on unidentified
                        aerospace phenomena, for 40 years: the <a target="_blank" href="https://cnes.fr/fr/web/CNES-en/5866-geipan-uap-investigation-unit-opens-its-files.php">GEIPAN</a>.
                        Nevertheless, this group has human and financial mean far from its American
                        counterpart. Indeed, the GEIPAN has only five permanent members and a network of a hundred people in France and Overseas
                        funded and has funding well below the hundreds of million dollars spent by Americans.

                <div id="menu-years" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h3>UFOs by year</h3>
                    <p>
                        Naturally, we notice on this visualization that the first appearance of UFOs is well around the year 1947 which
                        is considered as the year of the first major observation of a UFO. It follows, then a slight growth of about twenty
                        UFOs per year until 1972 which must surely be due to the craze that followed the observation of UFOs of the
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2011/06/0624first-flying-saucer-sighting/">24th of June 1947</a>
                        and the establishment from the Blue Book Project. From 1972 to 1992 the number of UFO appearances remains stable.
                        Nevertheless, since the years 93 begins a significant growth of the number of UFOs recorded each year. Indeed, we go from 309
                        UFOs observed in 1993 to 7536 in 2012. We believe this is no coincidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason for this growth may be due to the cinematographic and visual culture of the moment such as the American
                        series <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">X-files</a>,which broadcasted its first
                        9 seasons between the years 1993 and 2002 with an audience average of 15 million viewers per season at the first broadcast in
                        the United States. The modernization of telecommunication means or the arrival of the modern internet, which makes it easier to
                        report an appearance of a flying object, may explain the increase in reports in recent years. In addition, the appearance of
                        drones and automatic cameras to monitor the sky up to 50km altitude could also be one of the factors of this growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe that societal, cultural (movies, TV shows) and technological factors could have played an important role in the growth of
                        UFO reporting.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="menu-months" class="tab-pane fade">
                    <h3>UFOs by month</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most of the UFOs reported in the database are located in the United States and Western Europe. Knowing this
                        information and the fact that according to the visualization the highest number of UFO reported is between the
                        months of June to September, we can hypothesize that the climate could be one of the factors of this growth. In the regions observed,
                        we note that these months correspond to the summer months. Thus, during this period people are more likely to spend time outdoors and
                        even more able to observe one or more UFO(s). In addition, we can observe a constant decline as we return in the colder months and then
                        thereafter a more or less constant growth as we go back in the months when the climate becomes again favorable to spend time outside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, one of the possible other reasons for UFO reporting growth during the months of June, July,
                        August and September could be annual leave. Indeed, these months represent the most favorable months
                        to take vacations and consequently to spend more time outdoors as we know that the climate is generally more pleasant at this time of year

                    <h3>UFOs by day</h3>
                    <p>
                        As can we can see from the bar chart, the closer we get to the week-end, the more UFOs are reported. Knowing,
                        that the study areas of our database is mainly located in the United States and Western Europe and that the
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workweek_and_weekend">working days</a>
                        are in most cases from Monday to Friday and that the days of rest are from Saturday to Sunday, we can deduce that days of
                        rest can have a positive influence on the number of reported UFOs. Thus, this may explain that Saturday is generally the day with the
                        highest reporting rate of UFOs (18%) and the closer we get to the weekend, the higher the rate becomes.
