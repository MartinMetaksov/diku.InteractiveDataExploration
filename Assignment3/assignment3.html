        <p>To draw the family tree, we used d3v4.js. However, trees in d3 are not thought to be used as family trees.
            Therefore, the representation of the family tree of Trump's family is not represented in a classical way
            with horizontal connections to spouses.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in order to make the reading of the family tree as informative as possible, several things have
            been added:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The full name and age of every Trump family member.</li>
            <li>Twitter profile pictures of Trump's relatives (i.e. not the kids).</li>
            <li>A legend that illustrates (in a mix of color and style) children, spouses and divorces.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In order to distinguish between partners and children, we reduced the distance between the tree nodes for partners. Furthermore, we
        used separate line styles in order to underline their connection.</p>
