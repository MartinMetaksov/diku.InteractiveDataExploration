        <p>The map above allows us to get information about crime activities by interacting with the map and three filters.</p>
        <p>By interacting with each element one by one, we can see that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wednesday, Thursday, Friday represent 45% of total crime incidents with respectively 15% for each day.</li>
            <li>Between eight and noon until midnight the percentage of total crime incidents is at least equal to 20% for
                each time slot.</li>
            <li>Larceny and theft represent the highest rate of total crime incidents (20%).</li>
            <li>The Southern neighborhood has 18% of total crime incidents which makes this neighborhood the one who has
                proportionately more incidents. However, the Tenderloin neighborhood, which is by far the smallest neighborhood,
                has 9% of total crime incidents which is consequent considering its size.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By interacting with several elements at the same time, we can see that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Tenderloin neighborhood, is mainly the drug and narcotic neighborhood and we can also see that most of
                these incidents take place after noon. But the fact, that this district is mainly where we find drug and
                narcotic, can explain the other incidents that we can found there such as the assault, the other offenses,
                the larceny and theft, that take place at the same time.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the North-East neighborhoods (Tenderloin – Central – Northern - Southern) seems to be the
                one that concentrate the highest proportion of incidents with a percentage of 49%. Thus, this region of
                San Francisco is surely the least safe. </li>
        </ul>
