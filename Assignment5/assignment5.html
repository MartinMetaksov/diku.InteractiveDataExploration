        <p>The map above allows us to get information about crime activities in San Francisco by interacting with the map's regions and three filters.</p>
        <p>By interacting with each element one by one, we can see that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>45% of total crime happens on <a href="#" onclick="clickOnElements('#days-2, #days-3, #days-4');">Wednesday, Thursday and Friday</a>
                with 15% crime per day which is slightly higher than 14% for other days.</li>
            <li>From noon until midnight, the percentage of total crime incidents is equal to at least 20% for
                each time slot.</li>
            <li><a href="#" onclick="clickOnElements('#crimes-2');">Larceny/theft</a> represent the highest rate of total crime incidents (20%).</li>
            <li>The neighborhood with most crime in total is the
                <a href="#" onclick="clickOnElements('#district-5');">Southern neighborhood</a> with 18% of all crime incidents.
                However, the <a href="#" onclick="clickOnElements('#district-7');">Tenderloin neighborhood</a> which is by far the smallest neighborhood,
                has 9% of total crime incidents which makes it the neighborhood with most crime per area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By interacting with several elements at the same time, we can see that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="#" onclick="clickOnElements('#district-7');">Tenderloin neighborhood</a>
                is mainly the neighborhood of drugs and narcotics and we can also see that most of
                these incidents take place after noon. But the fact that we can find drugs and
                narcotics here could also explain the other incidents such as assault,
                larceny/theft and other offenses.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the
                <a href="#" onclick="clickOnElements('#district-4, #district-5, #district-7, #district-9');">North-East neighborhoods</a>
                (Tenderloin – Central – Northern - Southern) seem to be the
                ones that concentrate the highest proportion of incidents with a percentage of 49%. Thus, this region of
                San Francisco is surely the least safe.</li>
        </ul>
