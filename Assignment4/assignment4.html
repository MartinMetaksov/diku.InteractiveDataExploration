        The first visualization represents all 40 rows of the dataset in all of its features - it is a drawing of a hand.
        This means a total of 40 hands are displayed on top of each other. Since each hand has a slightly different position,
        placing them on top of each other obviously does not give a good representation of the data. For this
        reason, we have chosen to reduce the opacity of all hands at first and enable interactive features, through
        Vis. 2, allowing to highlight a specific hand when hovering/clicking. Vis. 2 on the other hand is a scatter plot, consisting
        of 40 points, representing the 1st and 2nd principal components of the same dataset (after PCA has been performed).
    </p>
    <p>
        In many real-life scenarios, the data that we have to work with consists of a large number of features, often correlated.
        PCA is a statistical method, which uses orthogonal transformations in order to reduce the dimensionality of the
        data. This allows for more effective use of the data (e.g. training machine learning models quicker), without
        losing too much information. In fact, features after the PCA are arranged by the amount of variance they describe,
        meaning that the first 2 or 3 features will often explain a huge deal of the data (and 2D or 3D data can be easily
        understood when visualized). This is obviously different for every data set, as it depends primarily on the correlation
        between features in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to achieve meaningful interactivity, we have:
        <ul>
            <li>Reduced the opacity of the hands in Vis. 1 - this preserves the overview of all hands, while allowing for individual
                hands to be highlighted</li>
            <li>Increased the size of dots on Vis. 2 - allowing to easily highlight a dot and get more information about that point</li>
            <li>Enabled hovering on each dot on Vis. 2 - this allows to preview each hand, slightly increasing its opacity, but still
                keeping it semi-blurred, for smoother toggling between the dots</li>
            <li>Enabled clicking on each dot on Vis. 2 - this allows to permanently highlight a hand on Vis. 1. We also highlight
                the points on Vis. 2, which have been clicked before, in order to allow users to keep track of what has been
                previously selected.</li>
        </ul>
